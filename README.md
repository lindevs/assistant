The **Lindevs Assistant** is a software designed to assist with various tasks, including generating QR codes,
recognizing text, chatting with LLM models (coming soon), and more. Lindevs Assistant runs 100% offline on the
computer. While online tools offer convenience and accessibility, the Lindevs Assistant ensures data privacy,
security, and no risk of data leakage.
